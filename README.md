# Jubilee

Jubilee is a custom vinyl creation website connecting to the Spotify API to select your favorite music, We wanted to create a site with a simple concept that could be worked on for years to come.

## Description

This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Remember that employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

While building this project I learned to:

- Technologies used: React, Spotify API, mongoDB, Apollo, GraphQL
- Oliver handled database and server side, Jose created the wireframe, handled database, server side, styling, and page creation.  
- Jacob worked on JavaScript, the Spotify API, and deployment, and Justin worked on styling and page creation  
- Try using a component library, such as Semantic UI, Chakra UI, or Ant Design.
